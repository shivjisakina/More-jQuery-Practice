## jQuery events I want to try working with
* .keydown() - Bind an event handler to the “keydown” JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element.
* .keypress() - Bind an event handler to the “keypress” JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element.
* .error() - Bind an event handler to the “error” JavaScript event.
* .resize() - Bind an event handler to the “resize” JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element.
* .scroll() - Bind an event handler to the “scroll” JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element.
* event.data - An optional object of data passed to an event method when the current executing handler is bound.
* .dblclick() - Bind an event handler to the “dblclick” JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element.

### Ajax Event Handlers
* .ajaxComplete() - Register a handler to be called when Ajax requests complete. 
* .ajaxStart() - Register a handler to be called when the first Ajax request begins. 
* .ajaxSuccess() - Attach a function to be executed whenever an Ajax request completes successfully.
